[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keesmulder/flexcircmix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/keesmulder/flexcircmix)

An R package to fit mixtures of flexible circular distributions, in particular with von Mises based symmetric inverse Batschelet distributions, which allow for both peaked and flat-topped distributions. Inference can be performed through EM, Bootstrap and MCMC.
