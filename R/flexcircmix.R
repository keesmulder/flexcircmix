#' Package 'flexcircmix'
#'
#'
#' Fit mixtures of flexible circular distributions. This package allows fitting
#' mixtures of peaked and flat-topped circular distributions from the von
#' Mises-based Batschelet-type family of distributions. Estimation is performed
#' through MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) for the Bayesian model and the EM
#' (Expectation-Maximization) Algorithm for the frequentist model. Uncertainty
#' quantification is provided by MCMC or the bootstrap.
