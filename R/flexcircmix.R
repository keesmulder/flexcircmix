#'
#'   Fit mixtures of flexible circular distributions. This package allows
#'   fitting mixtures of peaked and flat-topped circular distributions from the
#'   von Mises-based Batschelet-type family of distributions. Estimation is
#'   performed through MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) for the Bayesian model
#'   and the EM (Expectation-Maximization) Algorithm for the frequentist model.
