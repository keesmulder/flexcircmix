Description: Fit mixtures of flexible circular distributions, 
    in particular with symmetric Batschelet distributions, which allow
    for sharp peaks and flat tops. A novel alternative
    to the inverse Batschelet distribution is implemented called the 
    Power Batschelet distribution. Both frequentist and Bayesian 
    inference is implemented, through 
    the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the bootstrap, and 
    Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
